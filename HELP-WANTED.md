# Help Wanted

These are things that are suitable for new contributors to do that would be really useful right now:

- **Fact checking**: The [new medical system guide](http://alpha.genderkit.org.uk.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/resources/medical/) needs reading over by someone with knowledge of the UK medical system for trans people.
- **"Competitor" analysis**: Looking at other websites or apps in this area to identify things we're missing from existing genderkit.org.uk pages (or where a page on genderkit.org.uk seems like an obvious omission). Promising candidates that need looking through is [Solace](https://www.solace.lgbt/), [Trans Harm Reduction](https://transharmreduction.org/), [The DIY HRT Directory](https://diyhrt.wiki/) or anything else you know that covers the same kind of areas as us.
- **Information architecture**: With such a large amount of information on the site, it can be difficult for site visitors to know about everything that is on the site. We could do with a list of problems with the site along the lines of "I expected to find a link to <information about x> here, but it wasn't there". There's a new updated footer [on the alpha version here](http://alpha.genderkit.org.uk.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com) which might help a bit.
- **Proof reading**: The site should already be automatically spell checked, but what we really need is identifying bits of the site that are confusingly worded, or could be explained in a much simpler way, so that they could be rewritten. Are you able to get your (metaphorical or literal) red pen out and be an editor? 
- **A new Accessories page**: Drafting a proposal for a new "Accessories" page for genderkit.org.uk, going through options people might want to consider for gender presentation around bags, jewellery, watches, hats, scarves, purses/wallets, etc etc etc. This should be a guide for exploring possibilities and *not* prescriptive (i.e. not a guide for what accessories might help you "pass"). A particularly useful thing here would be ensuring there is a mix of things that are commonly considered "gendered" and "ungendered" in the UK.
- (CHALLENGING) **Research questions**: Have a look through things we've identified need research on [this list](https://github.com/genderkit/genderkit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs+research%22) and pick one to find research about - you'll ideally need skills on searching the academic / medical / legal literature to do this well.
- also... **general feedback**. Feedback is incredibly useful and we take every bit of it we get very seriously and generally all feedback tends to eventually result in changes being made to the site.

In around a couple of months, there should be many more opportunities to contribute, as we'll be moving some parts of what is currently genderkit.org.uk over to a new site, which should look something like:

![Mobile genderarchive.org.uk mockup](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/alpha.genderkit.org.uk/mobile.jpg)  
  
and on a desktop/tablet:

We will need people to help maintain the site, and people to suggest links that might be relevant to the various sections.
