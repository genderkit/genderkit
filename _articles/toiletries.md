Toiletries come in a wide variety of fragrances, some of which are associated with particular genders and some of which are not.

Fragrances in shampoos and conditioners will often persist longest, as fragrances will linger in hair.

Some brands of toiletries are available which contain little or no fragrance, such as Sanex or Simple.
