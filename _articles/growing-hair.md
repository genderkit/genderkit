Hair grows at an average rate of just over 1cm per month, though it can vary slightly from person to person depending on genetics {% cite loussouarn2005diversity %}.

There isn't any way to speed the growth rate of individual hairs up, but you can decrease the time it takes for your hair to grow by reducing the amount of hairs that are shortened by damage. When hair is grown longer it stays attached to your head accumulating damage, perhaps for up to several years, so you need to work harder to protect it than you would with shorter hair. The most important things you can do are:

- wash your hair regularly but not too often (twice a week works well for many people)
- when you wash hair with shampoo, always use a conditioner afterwards
- always wait for your hair to dry before detangling, brushing, combing, straightening or curling it
- dry your hair carefully, ideally patting it dry rather than rubbing it with a towel
- always rinse your hair after swimming in a pool or the sea

Many hair stylists and hair websites recommend that even when growing your hair, the ends should be trimmed every few months to remove damage. We have been unable so far to find expert advice from trichologists (specialists in hair and hair disorders) about whether this is necessary - but you may want to do it anyway, as this will help your hair look more healthy and well maintained.

You can find more detailed information on protecting your hair lower down on this page.

If you'd like you hair to be longer right now without having to wait for it to grow, an alternative you could consider is [hair extensions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hair-extensions.md %}). You may also be able to get a small increase in hair length from [hair straightening]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hair-straightening.md %}) if your hair is curly or wavy.

### Finding a hairdresser

Hair salons can be intimidating and confusing if you've only ever visited a barber's before. Here are a few tips that might help:

- Some hair salons advertise that they are specifically for men or for women; others will advertise themselves as "unisex". If you ask, salons will often accept you as a customer even if your gender does not match what they advertise. There are some hairdressers that specialise in gender variant clients, such as [Open Barbers](http://openbarbers.co.uk/), [Barberette](http://www.barberette.co.uk/), and [Gabriel Jordan](http://www.facebook.com/barber.gabriel).

- "Unisex" salons may have different prices listed for "men's" and "women's" hair, but normally this actually means they will charge a more expensive rate for people with longer hair.

- Some hair salons require you to make an appointment in advance; some will allow you to turn up without advance notice. If you need to make an appointment but aren't comfortable using the telephone, many salons will now allow you to make appointments via email or messages to their Facebook page.

- Salons usually have several stylists working in them who have different levels of expertise. You may be charged more for using a hair stylist who has more expertise, and you may be expected to say which level of experience you are expecting when you book your appointment.

- If your body or presentation is different to what people in the hair salon are expecting, you may be anxious about how accepting hair stylists will be. One way to reduce this anxiety is to contact the hair salon to tell them what to expect and ask if they are comfortable cutting your hair. Hair salons are often very LGBT friendly places, and hair stylists cut a very wide range of people's hair from all walks of life, so there is a good chance they will be accepting of you. If you'd like to be sure, you can also try contacting a local trans group in your area, who may be able to suggest hairdressers to you. You can use our [Local groups in the UK page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _resources/local.md %}) to find groups near to you.

### Protecting your hair

Hair is covered in a protective layer of scales called the cuticle. This protects the more delicate inner layers of the hair. If the scales are undamaged and smoothly layered, the hair will look glossy and smooth {% cite madnani2013hair %}.

A number of different stresses can cause the cuticle to be weakened or entirely removed - a process called hair weathering. Weathering has many different causes, including using heated straighteners and curlers, UV radiation, wind, humidity, sea salt, chlorinated water, dust, pollution, and friction. When weathering occurs, the more delicate inside layers of the hair - the cortex - are exposed, and start to unravel or fracture, which can lead to hair splitting or hair breaking off {% cite osorio2011hair %}.

You can protect against hair damage in the following ways:

- **friction damage** - friction is caused during washing, brushing, and towel drying {% cite robinson1976study %}. Most conditioners contain chemicals called silicones which lubricate the hair shaft, reducing the amount of friction and the amount of damage caused by combing {% cite osorio2011hair %}. Using conditioner significantly reduces the amount of damage done to the hair from combing {% cite tate1993quantification %}.
- **weakness from absorbing water** - hair becomes significantly more elastic when it is wet. Once your hair has absorbed water, much less force is required to stretch it to the point where it breaks. You should avoid trying to detangle your hair when it is wet - for example, after you have washed it, wait until it is dry before combing or brushing. If you have to detangle wet hair, use only your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to detangle it, and never a brush {% cite draelos2013shampoos -l 177 %}. You may also be able to reduce the amount of friction involved in drying by avoiding rubbing your hair with a towel and instead blotting/patting it or wrapping it in a towel.
- **chemical damage** - a number of chemicals can damage or remove the cuticle, particularly those used for bleaching, [colouring]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hair-colouring.md %}) and [permanently curling]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/permanent-hair-curling.md %}) hair {% cite gray2017hair %}, so having these treatments as infrequently as possible will help to maintain the health of hair. Another source of chemical damage is chlorinated swimming pool water {% cite horev2004exogenous %}, so rinse your hair well after you leave the pool to minimise exposure.
- **salt damage** - when hair dries, salt left in the hair dries into hard crystals which rub against the hair damaging it {% cite hoshowski1997hair horev2004exogenous %}. It is important to rinse your hair after you have been swimming in sea water.
- **hair bubbling** - [hair straightening]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hair-straightening.md %}) and [hair curling]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hair-curling.md %}) use very hot temperatures to change the shape of hair. If straighteners or curling tongs are applied to wet hair, the water absorbed by the hair rapidly boils and expands, producing cracks in the hair known as "bubbling" or "bubble hairs" {% cite osorio2011hair savitha2011bubble %}. You can avoid this by not using straighteners or curling tongs on your hair until it has fully dried, and using heat protection products on your hair before heat styling {% cite christian2011effects -l 16s %}.
- **nutritional deficiency** - if you are not eating a balanced diet containing enough proteins, vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids, you can end up with a nutritional deficiency. Some deficiencies may cause hair to become dry and brittle, cause hair to thin, or cause alopecia (balding) {% cite finner2013nutrition %}. Some hair products contain vitamins - these have little effect as you can't absorb vitamins directly into your hair {% cite peacock2005hair %}.
- **UV radiation** - when you are in sunlight, your hair is exposed to UV radiation from the sun which can damage your hair. Some hair products advertise UV protection, but often these aren't helpful, as they either wash out of the hair or don't coat it well {% cite draelos2014hair %}. You can protect your hair by wearing a hat or bandana - or by staying out of the sun between 11am and 3pm in summer, which is recommended to protect your skin from UV radiation. Your hair is more susceptible to UV damage when it is wet {% cite horev2004exogenous %}, so try and keep it dry when you are out in the sun.

Your hair stylist can advise you on caring for your hair - if you're not sure about how to look after your hair, ask them for advice.
