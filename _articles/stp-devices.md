### More information

STP devices are placed over the urethral opening (the hole you urinate from) and direct the urine forwards so that you can urinate standing, including into a urinal.

Most are shaped like a funnel or medicine spoon and come in a variety of colours. It is also possible to buy STP devices that are designed to resemble a penis.

You can also buy [packers]({% link _articles/packing.md %}) (devices placed in your underwear to create a bulge in your crotch) that contain a built in STP device to allow you to urinate through them.

### How much will it cost?

Basic STP devices can cost around £5-15. More complex devices (for example, built into a packer or prosthetic) can cost significantly more. 

UK retailers of STP devices include [SheWee](http://www.shewee.com/), [Whiz](http://www.whizproducts.co.uk) and [Uberkinky](http://www.uberkinky.co.uk).
