Forehead recontouring involves changing the shape of the bones of the skull. This can often be achieved by opening the forehead and shaving down the bone. In some cases, it is necessary to cut out a section of bone, trim it, and replace it in a new position using titanium plates or screws. Forehead recontouring is often combined with hairline advance surgery and [brow lift]({% link _articles/brow-lift.md %}) surgery {% cite altman2017 -l 305 %}.

Possible complications of forehead recontouring include alopecia (hair loss), bones not correctly growing back together, and mucocele (mucus filled cyst). These complications may require further operations, and it may not be possible to completely fix some problems that forehead recontouring can cause {% cite morrison2016facial %}.
