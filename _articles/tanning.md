### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
There is no safe or healthy way to get a tan from sunlight, according to the  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence {% cite nice-sunlight %}.

{% include warning warning=warn %}

The British Photodermatology Group and British Association of Dermatologists have released [a joint statement](http://www.bad.org.uk/for-the-public/skin-cancer/sunbeds) stating that the use of sunbeds should be strongly discouraged. The NHS provide an [Are Sunbeds Safe? page](https://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/852.aspx) which has further information on sunbeds. It is **illegal** to allow people who are under the age of 18 to use tanning beds, under section 2 of the [Sunbeds (Regulation) Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/20/section/2).

Some people incorrectly think that having a tan is useful protection against sun damage to skin and skin cancer. In fact, the risks of exposure outweigh any protective effect {% cite nice-sunlight %}.

Common risks of overexposure to sunlight are skin cancer, cataracts, and premature wrinkling and ageing.

This does not mean that people should avoid all sunlight - which is important for vitamin D levels and emotional well-being. However, people should pay careful attention to the advice given on how to reduce the risks. More guidance and information is available [on the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/skin/Pages/Sunsafe.aspx).

### Are there other options?

An easy and cheap alternative to tanning is a fake spray tan product (usually containing dihydroxyacetone), which usually costs £10-20 and can be bought from high street shops or online retailers. Fake spray tans do not provide protection from the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight, so you should continue to follow the guidelines for sunlight exposure. Fake tan pills (actually pills of highly concentrated food colouring) are banned in the UK as they are unsafe to use.
