### What do I need first?

You will normally need:

- *to be registered with a GP surgery* 

  There is information on how to do this on [the NHS England website](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/gps/how-to-register-with-a-gp-surgery/) and [the NHS Scotland website](https://www.nhsinform.scot/care-support-and-rights/nhs-services/doctors/registering-with-a-gp-practice). In Wales, you can use the [NHS 111 Wales website](https://111.wales.nhs.uk/localservices/) to find a local GP surgery and use the instructions on the GP surgery website.

- *to have a deed poll or statutory declaration*

  If you are changing the name listed on your NHS records, you will also normally need a [deed poll]({% link _articles/name-change-by-deed-poll.md %}) or [statutory declaration]({% link _articles/name-change-by-statutory-declaration.md %}).

You *do not* need:

- a [Gender Recognition Certificate]({% link _articles/obtaining-a-grc.md %})
- a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %})
- to have had [surgery]({% link _resources/surgery.md %})

### How do I update my NHS records?

You can change your name, title, or gender with the NHS at any time you like by telling your GP surgery. 

Most GP surgeries will be able to update your details if you ask at reception. However, some GP surgeries may be unsure of the procedure for how to do it. You may find it helpful to give them these links which explain how they can update your details:

- in *England*, on [the PCSE website](https://pcse.england.nhs.uk/help/patient-registrations/adoption-and-gender-reassignment-processes). If the GP surgery has further queries, they can contact the PCSE using [this page](https://pcse.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/patient-registrations-enquiry-categories/adoptions-and-gender-reassignment).
- in *Wales*, on the [Umbrella Cymru website](https://umbrellagwent.od2.vtiger.com/kb/article/640439-Changing-Personal-Details-at-the-GP?catid=1&subid=4)
- in *Scotland*, on the [NHS National Services Scotland website](https://www.nss.nhs.scot/medical-services/patient-registration-and-medical-records/how-to-change-patient-details/) (you can find further information about your rights in [this Freedom of Information disclosure](https://www.nss.nhs.scot/publications/foi-000084-requirements-for-processing-a-change-of-gender-and-title/foi-000084-requirements-for-processing-a-change-of-gender-and-title-html/) and in [this document for staff in Greater Glasgow and Clyde](https://www.nhsggc.org.uk/media/255885/nhsggc_equalities__changing_your_chi.pdf))

If your GP surgery is still unhappy to do this, or request a Gender Recognition Certificate before making a change, you may wish to show your GP [the General Medical Council guidance on this issue](https://www.gmc-uk.org/professional-standards/ethical-hub/trans-healthcare#Confidentiality-and-equality).

If you are still experiencing issues, take a look at the advice on [our page about common healthcare issues]({% link _resources/problems.md %}).

### What happens next?

The NHS has multiple different systems that store details about patients. Most of these will be automatically updated when you tell your GP surgery, but you may find some hospitals or other NHS services are not automatically updated, and you may have to tell them as well. 

Each NHS system is different and able to hold different information about [titles]({% link _explore/titles.md %}) (or lack of title) and about the gender of the patient. 

In most NHS systems there are gender options for not only male and female, but often also a "not specified" marker which may be useful if you do not wish to have male or female recorded. 

Usually, when you change your gender marker you will be assigned a new [NHS number](
https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/records/nhs-number/Pages/what-is-the-nhs-number.aspx) in England and Wales, or assigned a new [CHI number](https://www.nhsinform.scot/healthy-living/screening/screening-information-for-the-transgender-community) in Scotland.

### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Changing gender marker may affect whether you are invited to important medical screening tests that you still need. Read the whole of this page to ensure you still receive the correct tests.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

During your life the NHS will invite you to a number of screening tests for common conditions. As the prevalence of these conditions is different for men and women, some tests only invite people who have "female" on their NHS record, and some tests only invite people who have "male" on their NHS record. This can mean people who have changed their gender marker can invited to the wrong tests for the body parts they have.

When you change your NHS gender marker, you should remember that you may not receive reminders for the tests you need, and may have to ask for them yourself. You can read more about screening tests and which tests you might need:

- on the [UK Government website](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-information-for-transgender-people/nhs-population-screening-information-for-trans-people)
- on the [NHS Wales website](https://phw.nhs.wales/services-and-teams/cervical-screening-wales/information-resources/transgender-information/screening-information-for-people-who-are-transgender-non-binary-gender-diverse/)
- and on the [Cancer Research UK website](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/screening/trans-and-non-binary-cancer-screening)

In *Scotland*, you will normally be invited to the correct tests automatically (unless the gender marker on your records was changed before 2016). You can read more about testing in Scotland on [the NHS Inform website](https://www.nhsinform.scot/healthy-living/screening/screening-information-for-the-transgender-community).
