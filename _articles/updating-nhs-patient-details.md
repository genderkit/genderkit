### Who can update their NHS records?

In some parts of the UK, updating the gender (sex marker) on your NHS records is not permitted for *people who are under 18*. For up-to-date information, see [the NHS PCSE Patient Registrations page](https://pcse.england.nhs.uk/help/patient-registrations/gender-reassignment) (England) or [the NHS National Services Scotland page](https://www.nss.nhs.scot/medical-services/patient-registration-and-medical-records/how-to-change-patient-details/) (Scotland).

### How do I update my NHS records?

You can change your name, title, or gender with the NHS at any time you like by telling your GP surgery. 

You can find full details of how to do this, and what else you might need to consider, on [the TransActual Updating Your Medical Records page](https://transactual.org.uk/updating-medical-records/).

### Where can I learn more?

You can also read about updating your NHS details on [the DMC blog](https://www.dillonmarshallcowell.co.uk/legal-transition-blog/changing-your-nhs-number).
