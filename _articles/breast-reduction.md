### Are there other options?

Breast reduction removes only part of the breast tissue in order to reduce the size of the breasts. For complete removal of the breasts, see [periareolar mastectomy]({% link _articles/periareolar-mastectomy.md %}) and [double incision mastectomy]({% link _articles/double-incision-mastectomy.md %}).

For temporarily reducing the visibility of breasts, you could try [binding]({% link _articles/binding.md %}) or [disguising your body shape]({% link _articles/disguising-body-shape.md %}).

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about breast reduction, including information about costs, on [the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-procedures/breast-reduction-female/).

### Preparing for a surgical procedure

Doing some preparation in advance can help make sure everything goes smoothly during your hospital stay and recovery. To help you avoid forgetting to do or buy something we have created a [Getting ready for gender surgeries page]({% link surgery-checklist.md %}).
