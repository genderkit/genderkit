### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
UK passports can only show a gender marker of male or female.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Home Office guidance indicates that if you do not request either "male" or "female" your application should be rejected {% cite hmpo2022guidance %}.

{% capture warn %}
You usually must update any foreign passports you hold before updating your British passport.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

There is more information for people with dual citizenship further down the page.

{% capture warn %}
Any current visa you hold will not be automatically transferred to your new passport.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

There is more information relating to visas further down the page.

### What do I need first?

To update the name in your UK passport, you will need:

- *proof of your name change*

  This can be either a [deed poll]({% link _articles/name-change-by-deed-poll.md %}) or [statutory declaration]({% link _articles/name-change-by-statutory-declaration.md %}). Photocopies are not accepted, so you must either send the original document or a [certified copy](https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document).
- *proof of using your new name*

  This can be things like bank statements, utility bills, council tax bills, or payslips that show you using a new name.

To update the gender marker in your UK passport, you will need:

- either *a letter indicating your change of gender*

  This is a letter written by a medical professional which should clearly state that the professional believes your change of gender is "expected to be permanent". The letter could be written by your GP or a gender specialist you have seen at a gender clinic, and they will normally charge you money for writing this letter. If the letter does not indicate this is a "permanent" change, your application may be rejected and you may need to make a new application. [Home Office guidance](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/974817/Gender_recognition_V8.pdf) suggests that if you cannot provide such a letter, you might instead be able to make a statement confirming you permanently use the preferred identity instead.

- or *a gender recognition certificate*

  You *do not need* a [gender recognition certificate (GRC)]({% link _articles/obtaining-a-grc.md %}) to change the name or gender on your passport, driving license, or any other identification other than your birth certificate. However, if you have a GRC already, you do not need to send evidence of your change of gender or a letter, and can send either the GRC or your updated birth or adoption certificate.

### How do I get a new passport?

Updating a passport is different depending on whether you already have a UK passport or not.

{% capture title %}I already have a UK passport{% endcapture %}
{% capture body %}
You can update your name and/or gender marker on an existing UK passport either [online](https://www.gov.uk/apply-renew-passport) or by post. Forms for postal updates are available from your local post office. You will need to return your old passport along with the application. If you have lost your passport, you will need to declare it lost. 

You will need to send the passport office two [passport photographs](https://www.gov.uk/photos-for-passports). If your appearance has changed significantly you will also need to get the photographs [countersigned](https://www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications). If you are in doubt, it can be better to get them countersigned, as having to respond to a request to send in new photographs can slow the process down. 

If you are under 18, you may need to provide written consent from everyone with parental responsibility (or legal guardianship) for you {% cite hmpo2022guidance %}.

It may take some time to receive your new passport. You can find out the current wait time for a new passport on [the GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-passport-office/about-our-services).
{% endcapture %}
{% include details body=body title=title %}

{% capture body %}

The procedure for changing names and gender markers on passports from other countries varies significantly by country. To find out more about your situation, contact your nearest Embassy or Consulate for the country where your passport was issued.

If you have *dual citizenship* and hold any other passports: 

- If your country will issue new passports with an altered gender marker, you need to [update them before updating your UK passport](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-of-name-guidance/use-and-change-of-names). Some countries will say that your UK passport gender marker must be updated before they will do this - in this situation you may wish to get legal advice from a legal organisation like [The Trans Legal Clinic](https://www.translegalclinic.com/) or [The LGBTQ+ Law Clinic](https://www.lgbtqlawclinic.co.uk/).
- If your country will not issue new passports for trans people, you [do not need to update your other passports](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-of-name-guidance/use-and-change-of-names#exceptions-guidance).
{% endcapture %}
{% include details body=body title=title %} 

{% capture title %}I don't have any existing passports{% endcapture %}
{% capture body %}

To apply for your own UK adult passport you must be either:

- 16 or over
- or will turn 16 within the next three weeks.

If you are under 16, your parent or guardian must apply for a child passport for you, and to change gender marker you must provide written consent from everyone with parental responsibility (or legal
guardianship) {% cite hmpo2022guidance %}.

If you already have a [gender recognition certificate (GRC)]({% link _articles/obtaining-a-grc.md %}) or an updated birth certificate, you can apply for a passport as normal with your updated birth or adoption certificate. Name change documents and letters from doctors are not required.

If you *do not* have a [gender recognition certificate (GRC)]({% link _articles/obtaining-a-grc.md %}) and updated birth certificate, you will need to fill in the application for a new passport, and include your existing birth or adoption certificate along with the documents listed above.

In both cases, you will need to send the passport office two [passport photographs](https://www.gov.uk/photos-for-passports), which will need to be [countersigned](https://www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications).

{% endcapture %}

### How much does getting a new passport cost?

At the time of writing (April 2025) the cost of a new or updated UK adult passport is £94.50 (online) or £107 (paper form). You can find up-to-date information on [the HM Passport Office website](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport).

### Visas

If you have visas in your old passport and still wish to travel to those countries, what you need to do will vary depending on the country.
- Some countries will allow you to travel with both your new valid passport and your old invalidated passport, but this will out you every time that you need to show your visa.
- Other countries will require you to have the visa transferred or possibly even apply for a new visa.

You should check with any country you hold a visa with before you update your details, or just apply for new visas.

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about obtaining or renewing passports for people who have changed name or gender marker on [the HM Passport Office website](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251703/Applying_for_a_passport_additional_information.PDF).

There is very detailed information on the exact rules for when a change of gender is permitted and what evidence needs to be provided in [this HM Passport Office document](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/974817/Gender_recognition_V8.pdf).
