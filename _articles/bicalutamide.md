### What should I be aware of?

{% include get-tested %}

{% capture warn %}

{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

{% capture warn %}
Taking anti-androgens without also taking another sex hormone (e.g. [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) can cause osteoporosis.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Bicalutamide blocks the effects of testosterone, but does not reduce testosterone levels. Bicalutamide may also cause some increase in oestrogen levels, which can cause breast development {% cite neyman2019bicalutamide angus2020systematic %}.

Bicalutamide is an antiandrogen which is sometimes used outside of the UK. In the UK, endocrinologists usually prescribe [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) instead, as while bicalutamide is much cheaper to obtain, it is considered to potentially have higher risks of side effects {% cite vincent2018transgender -l 158 %}. GnRH agonists are considered to have a very good side-effect profile {% cite seal2017 %}.

Bicalutamide is not recommended for use by people under the age of 18, who are pregnant or could possibly become pregnant, or who are breastfeeding {% cite bicalutamide %}.

### Are there other options?

Medications with similar effects whose side effects whose risks and side-effects are much better understood are [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}), [spironolactone]({% link _articles/spironolactone.md %}), and [cyproterone]({% link _articles/cyproterone.md %}).
