Clitoroplasty involves surgically constructing a neoclitoris (artificially created clitoris), normally out of tissue taken from the dorsal (top) side of the glans penis (head of the penis). This organ is able to provide sexual sensation and in many cases the ability to orgasm. The penis is completely destroyed in the process of creating the clitoris.

Clitoroplasty only creates the clitoris (the small organ that acts as a focus of sexual sensation). The rest of the vulva (external part of the genitalia) is created by [labiaplasty]({% link _articles/labiaplasty.md %}), and the internal vaginal canal by [vaginoplasty]({% link _articles/vaginoplasty.md %}). These operations are usually carried out together, though some people choose not to have a vaginoplasty.

The most common technique for clitoroplasty is to use a small triangular piece of the dorsum (top side) of the glans penis, near to the corona (raised ring at the base of the glans). This is moved to the new position along with the neurovascular bundle (connecting tube of nerves and blood vessels) to supply it that would originally have run down the top edge of the penis.

A variety of different variations on this basic technique exist, such as neourethroclitoroplasty (utilising urethral tissue as part of building the clitoris) {% cite trombetta2015technical %}, moving the remainder of the glans to between the urethra and neoclitoris for additional sensation {% cite selvaggi2011gender %}, and corona glans Clitoroplasty {% cite giraldo2004corona %}. There is no clear medical evidence about which techniques are most effective. You may wish to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques with your surgeon. 

Historically, alternative techniques such as a free graft of the tip of the penis {% cite hage1994sculpturing %}, retention of the entire glans, or use of the ventral (bottom) side of the glans {% cite bellringer:2007 -l 213 %} have also been used, but these are now much less common.

Creation of a neoclitoris is a delicate surgery and is not without risk. It is common for there to be no sensation in the clitoris for many months after surgery. Around 2-5% of people who have a clitoroplasty do not gain sensation in the clitoris at all {% cite bellringer:2007 selvaggi2011gender  -l 214 %}, and around 15-25% are unable to reach orgasm after clitoroplasty, though findings have varied significantly between medical studies on this topic {% cite wylie:2016 %}.

A more dramatic complication is for the blood supply to the clitoris not to survive the surgery. This causes necrosis of the clitoris (the tissue dies from lack of blood supply). In this situation, some sensation may remain from the nerves leading to the area {% cite bellringer:2007 -l 215 %}. This affects around 1% of patients who have a clitoroplasty. 

### Preparing for a surgical procedure

Doing some preparation in advance can help make sure everything goes smoothly during your hospital stay and recovery. To help you avoid forgetting to do or buy something we have created a [Getting ready for gender surgeries page]({% link surgery-checklist.md %}).

### How much will it cost?

A operation in the UK to perform [labiaplasty]({% link _articles/labiaplasty.md %}) and [clitoroplasty]({% link _articles/clitoroplasty.md %}) costs around £11-12000.

If you have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will usually provide funding for labiaplasty and [penectomy]({% link _articles/penectomy.md %}), [orchidectomy]({% link _articles/orchidectomy.md %}), [clitoroplasty]({% link _articles/clitoroplasty.md %}) and/or [vaginoplasty]({% link _articles/vaginoplasty.md %}). You will normally need to meet the following conditions:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the
patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications
or is otherwise unable to take hormones)
- at least 12 months’ living continuously in a gender role that is
congruent with the gender identity {% cite cr181 %}.
