### How do I stay safe?
{% capture warn %}
Taking GnRH agonists without also taking a sex hormone (e.g.
[oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %})) or inadequate levels of sex hormones can cause osteoporosis or early heart disease {% cite seal2017 %}. 
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Taking a sex hormone along with GnRH agonists will avoid the risk of osteoporosis or early heart disease. If GnRH agonists are being used without an additional sex hormone, [DEXA (bone density) scans](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dexa-scan/) which measure bone mineral density may be needed {% cite murjan2017 -l 197 %}.

{% capture warn %}
GnRH agonists do not provide reliable contraception {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}. They do not remove the risk of making someone pregnant, and they do not remove the risk of becoming pregnant.

### Who might want GnRH agonists?
<section class="agerestrictions">
<h3 id="note">Note</h3>
<p>NHS policy on treatment of under-16s has been affected by recent High Court rulings, and is subject to change. This page will be updated regularly.</p>
</section>

- *If you have testes*, treatment with GnRH agonists will reduce your testosterone levels. GnRH agonists will cause an initial rise in testosterone levels for the first few weeks of use, which is sometimes stopped by a short course of [cyproterone]({% link _articles/cyproterone.md %}) {% cite seal:2007 -l 170 %}.

- *If you have ovaries*, treatment with GnRH agonists will reduce your oestrogen and progesterone levels. This will cause periods to stop, along with halting breast growth. Treatment with GnRH agonists is not normally necessary for people taking [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) as testosterone normally adequately suppresses production of oestrogen.

- *If you do not have gonads (ovaries and/or testes)*, you will not need to take GnRH agonists. This means that after [orchidectomy]({% link _articles/orchidectomy.md %}) or [salpingo-oophorectomy]({% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %}), there is no longer any need to use GnRH agonists.

- *If you are going through, or about to start puberty*, GnRH agonists can be used to delay puberty. The effects of GnRH agonists when used in this way are considered a fully reversible treatment {% cite hembree2009endocrine %}, and may reduce the distress of going through the "wrong" puberty {% cite giordano2020 %} as well as the need for some other treatments later in life {% cite wpath7 %}. This is generally considered safe, though there is some evidence that suppressing puberty may have a negative impact on bone development {% cite giordano2020 %}. Further information is available on [the GIDS website](https://gids.nhs.uk/evidence-base).

  Due to a recent high court ruling, under-16s will not receive this treatment from the NHS in England and Wales without a 'best interests' court order {% cite specEngDec20Update %}. It is likely that private clinics will adopt similar policies. You can find more information about 'best interests' court proceedings on the Something Or Other Website (TODO!!).

### Are there other options?

Alternatives to GnRH agonists include [cyproterone]({% link _articles/cyproterone.md %}), [spironolactone]({% link _articles/spironolactone.md %}), and [anastrozole]({% link _articles/anastrozole.md %}). 

While these options are cheaper, GnRH agonists are generally preferred by NHS clinicians, as GnRH agonists are considered to have an excellent side-effect profile with minimal side-effects compared to the other alternatives {% cite seal2017 -l 236 %}.

{% capture specifics %}
GnRH treatment is available to people with testes who have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) on the NHS. It is also used by the NHS to prevent puberty in under 18s, and sometimes in conjunction with testosterone treatment to stop menstruation (periods) {% cite ngicns-endocrine -l 5 %}. Under-16s attending the GIDS clinic in England will require a 'best interests' court judgement to receive this treatment {% cite specEngDec20Update %}.

### What kinds are there?

Commonly used GnRH agonists in the UK are Goserelin (Zoladex), Triptorelin (Decapeptyl) and Leuprorelin (Prostap). Certain clinicians also offer Buserelin (Suprecur/Suprefact) and Nafarelin (Synarel).

GnRH agonists are usually supplied as injections that are administered once every four weeks {% cite prostap zoladex1 %}, twelve weeks {% cite zoladex prostap3 decapeptyl3%}, or six months {% cite decapeptyl %}.

Buserelin and Nafarelin are also available as a nasal spray that is administered twice daily {% cite buserelin nafarelin buserelin-nafarelin-ggp %}; this could be a good option if you have difficulty with needles, but these are not normally prescribed on the NHS, and you will still need to have regular blood tests.

### What else might I want?

GnRH agonists are often used in conjunction with a sex hormone like [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}).

GnRH agonists may cause erectile dysfunction in people with penises. If this is not desired, it can be treated with [sildenafil]({% link _articles/sildenafil.md %}), [tadalafil]({% link _articles/tadalafil.md %}) or [vardenafil]({% link _articles/vardenafil.md %}).
