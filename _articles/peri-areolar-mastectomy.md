Not all breast tissue is removed in mastectomy, and it does not remove the risk of breast cancer.

Typically, mastectomy is performed using the [double incision mastectomy]({% link _articles/double-incision-mastectomy.md %}) technique. However, some people may be able to undergo peri-areolar mastectomy instead.

Peri-areolar mastectomy is usually used only to remove small breasts (B-cup or less) where the patient also has good skin elasticity. 

Unlike double incision mastectomy, peri-areolar mastectomy results in significantly less visible scarring, but may also cause over-reduction of the breast leaving a depression or dip in the chest. Repositioning of nipples cannot be carried out during peri-areolar mastecomy without leaving very conspicious scarring, unlike double incision mastectomy {% cite seal:2007 --location 227 %}.

Mastectomy, like other gender surgeries, will normally require two opinions from gender specialists (such as NHS Gender Identity Clinic staff or private specialists) who have assessed you for suitability for surgery.

The cost of privately obtaining a mastectomy in the UK is around £xxxx.

If you have a formal diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the NHS will usually provide funding for a mastectomy.

You can read more about mastectomy on the [NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mastectomy/Pages/Introduction.aspx).
