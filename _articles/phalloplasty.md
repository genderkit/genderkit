{% capture warn %}
Phalloplasty is a complex surgical procedure with significant risks that you must understand before it is carried out. Phalloplasty usually causes significant scarring due to skin grafting (usually on the lower arm). Complications are also common in this operation, particularly problems with urinating which may require surgical correction, including urethral strictures and fistulae (urethra closing up so you cannot urinate) {% cite frey2017update -l 732 %}.

Phalloplasty is surgery to create a penis, usually with the ability to urinate out of the end of it, and to make it erect. Often [scrotoplasty]({% link _articles/scrotoplasty.md %}) is performed at the same time.

Before phalloplasty surgery, you will need to choose to decide whether you wish to be able to use the penis to pass urine standing, and whether you wish to be able to make the penis hard for penetrative sex using prosthetic implants. Both of these will increase the length and complexity of surgery.

For some people, phalloplasty can provide a significant improvement in mental health. There is overall agreement in medical studies that after gender confirming medical interventions, rates of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric symptoms reduce considerably {% cite arcelus2017 -l 181 %}. However, as with other major life changes, you may find that [counselling]({% link _articles/counselling.md %}) before and after surgery may be helpful.

An alternative option to phalloplasty is [metoidioplasty]({% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %}). Phalloplasty usually creates an average sized penis, compared to the much smaller (5-7cm length) results of metoidioplasty. However, as metoidioplasty uses only clitoral tissue, it will usually provide an organ with good erogenous sensation which can become erect without the use of prostheses. Metoidioplasty also often requires less surgeries, less time in hospital, and less scarring. 

Phalloplasty involves a degree of risk. UK surgeons have reported a 3% rate of phallus loss, thought this risk can be reduced by avoiding smoking and not being overweight. In the event of phallus loss, further attempts can be made 6-12 months later {% cite christopher2017 -l 284 %}. It is important to note that if a prosthetic erectile implant is used, it will likely need replacement later in life, so you will need to be prepared for further surgeries in the future {% cite christopher2017 -l 299 %}.

### Where can I learn more?

You can find more information about phalloplasty and metoidioplasty on the [St. Peter's Andrology Centre website](https://www.andrology.co.uk/phalloplasty).

### Types of phalloplasty

Phalloplasty requires reuse of skin from some other part of the body. Three types of phalloplasty are performed in the UK, which differ in which site skin is taken from {% cite christopher2017 -l 281 %}:

- **radial artery** phalloplasty using a free flap from the forearm; this is the most commonly used technique in the UK
- **pubic** phalloplasty using a local flap from the lower belly and crotch area; this may not be possible if you have had surgeries on your abdomen such as Caesarian section or hysterectomy
- **antero-lateral thigh** phalloplasty using either a free or pedicled flap from the outer thigh

The amount of sensation in the penis will depend on the technique used, with radial artery phalloplasty giving the best results. There is no guarantee of sensation: UK surgeons report 10% of patients have no sensation after two years with radial artery phalloplasty {% cite christopher2017 -l 282 %}.

The donor area receives skin grafts to replace the removed skin (normally from the buttocks {% cite christopher2017 -l 285 %}), but there will be significant scarring on donor area {% cite frey2017update %}, and it should not be exposed to strong sunlight as it will get sunburned easily {% cite christopher2017 -l 286 %}. 

Other types of phalloplasty are possible but not normally performed in the UK, including MLD (muscular latissimus dorsi meaning the side of the chest or back), Gracilis, Fibular (lower leg), Deltoid (upper arm/shoulder), and Gillies (from the abdomen but using a pedicled tube) {% cite christopher2017 -l 281 %}.

### Erections

Several options are available for people who wish to have erections:

- **inflatable** prostheses: this is an implant inside the penis. This is usually inflated by a pump, usually hidden inside one of the testicular prostheses, which you squeeze to inflate the penis implant. This is the usual approach to providing the ability to get erections used in the UK {% cite andrology2016patients %}. It is important to note that if an inflatable erectile implant is used, it will likely need replacement later in life, so you will need to be prepared for further surgeries in the future {% cite christopher2017 -l 299 %}.
- **malleable** rods: these are implanted into the penis. These are not usually used in the UK as the implant exerts constant pressure on the skin, causing damage over time {% cite andrology2016patients %}. 
- **external** aids: these are devices worn around the penis. They can either provide support to hold it straight and stiff, constrict around the base of the penis to hold blood in to stiffen the penis, or provide additional length and girth by providing a sleeve around the penis.

### Preparing for a surgical procedure

Doing some preparation in advance can help make sure everything goes smoothly during your hospital stays and recovery. To help you avoid forgetting to do or buy something we have created a [Getting ready for gender surgeries page]({% link surgery-checklist.md %}).

### How much will it cost?

If you have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will usually provide funding for phalloplasty or [metoidioplasty]({% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %}). The NHS will normally also fund hair removal from the donor skin sites for phalloplasty, either by [laser hair reduction]({% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}) or [electrolysis]({% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}). You will normally need to meet the following conditions:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the
patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications
or is otherwise unable to take hormones)
- at least 12 months’ living continuously in a gender role that is
congruent with the gender identity {% cite cr181 %}.

{% include surgery-costs %}

If not funded by the NHS, the cost of a phalloplasty performed in the UK is approximately £40,000-£70,000 (last updated July 2020). The exact cost will depends on exactly what surgery is required, and determining the best option for you will require a consultation with a surgeon. The only clinic currently performing phalloplasty in the UK is [St. Peter's Andrology Centre](https://www.andrology.co.uk/phalloplasty).
