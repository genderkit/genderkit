### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
There is no published medical research into the risks of tucking we are aware of. Perform tucking at your own risk.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}
Possible side effects of tucking are:

- skin irritation and [fungal infections](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Ringworm/Pages/Introduction.aspx), particularly if tape is being used {% cite conard2017supporting %}
- defects or hernias at the external inguinal ring {% cite feldman2006transgender -l 7 %}
- infections such as epididymoorchitis,
prostatitis, or cystitis {% cite deutsch2016guidelines -l 93 %}
- chronic testicular pain {% cite deutsch2016guidelines -l 93 %}

We are not aware of any research into how common these side effects are.

Testes require a lower temperature than body temperature to produce sperm. The effects of tucking on fertility have not been studied, but as tucking keeps the testes closer to the body than normal, this may result in reduced fertility.

If you hope to [store your sperm]({% link _articles/gamete-storage.md %}), you may wish to avoid tucking for several months beforehand.

### Are there other options?

Tucking is often only necessary while wearing tighter clothing in which the shape of your crotch is likely to be visible. Often, a simpler way to hide this part of your body is to wear loose clothing like a skirt, dress, or thick baggy trousers which are more concealing. You can read more about this kind of approach on [our page about Disguising body shape]({% link _articles/disguising-body-shape.md %}).

Tucking can be significantly easier after [orchidectomy]({% link _articles/orchidectomy.md %}) surgery. 

### How do I tuck?

Tucking involves pulling the penis backwards between the legs. Usually, the testes (testicles) are also moved forwards. 

To keep the genitals held in this position, one or both of the following are normally used:

- *tight underwear or shorts*: look for stretchy fabric containing elastane, which is sometimes known as Lycra. You should be able to find this kind of clothing described as "shapewear", "control pants" or "control knickers" in most shops that sell underwear. Another option using similar fabrics is cycling shorts or swimwear. You could also try using two pairs of briefs in a smaller size than normal on top of each other, which may be more comfortable in warm weather.
- *medical tape*: this usually requires shaving the area to be comfortable. Make sure you use tape which is designed to be used for medical or sports purposes as this is suitable to spend an extended period on skin. Other types of tape, such as packing tape or duct tape, can cause damage to your skin.

Some people find it easier to use a specialised item of clothing called a "gaff" or "concealing underwear" designed specifically to hold the genitals in place. UK retailers include:

- [Guiniveres](https://guiniveres.co.uk)
- [StripItBack](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/Stripitback)
- [Trans Shop UK](https://uktransshop.co.uk/collections/gaffs)

Lingerie that functions as a gaff can also be purchased from places like:

- [Carmen Liu Lingerie](https://www.carmenliulingerie.co.uk)
- [ZHE by Karyn Elizabeth](https://zhebykarynelizabeth.com)

Some people are able to partly or completely insert the testes into the entrances to the inguinal canals to further hide them, but it is usually not necessary to do this in order to tuck effectively, and the health risks of doing this are unknown.
