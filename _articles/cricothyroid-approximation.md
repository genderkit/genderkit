{% capture warn %}
This technique is a surgery with a number of risks you need to understand before it is carried out. Common side effects are a quieter voice, a voice with less vocal range, or decreased clarity. The surgery may also result in no change to the pitch of the voice or a deepening of the voice {% cite song2017transgender --location 807 %}.

[Speech therapy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/speech-therapy.md %}) is able to allow the majority of people to raise the pitch and change the qualities of their voice.

However, in a minority of the cases, this is not the case, and surgery can be carried out, though it requires subsequent additional speech therapy afterwards {% cite seal:2007 --location 194 %}.

While a variety of different approaches to increasing vocal pitch have been tried, there is currently little research into what the long term effects of these surgeries are, and how long the effects will last is unknown {% cite van2017effectiveness --location 244e4 %}.
