### Are there other options?

The simplest and most commonly used way of changing name in the UK is a [name change by deed poll]({% link _articles/name-change-by-deed-poll.md %}). However, if you are unable to find the two independent witnesses which are required for a deed poll change of name, you may wish to use name change by statutory declaration instead.

### How do I change my name by statutory declaration?

To change your name by statutory declaration, you will need to contact a solicitor and ask them to witness your signing of a change of name document. 

There is an example statutory declaration of change of name document on [the GOV.UK website](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/118854/19049-statutory-declaration.pdf).

Once you have changed your name, you will need to update your details with lots of different organisations. You can find out who you need to notify and how to do it on our page about [telling organisations]({% link _articles/telling-organisations.md %}).

### How much will it cost?

This varies depending on which UK nation you are in:

- in *England* and *Wales*, the charge for witnessing a statutory declaration is set at £5 in law {% cite commisioners1993 %}.
- in *Scotland*, a statutory declaration can be witnessed for free by a Justice of the Peace - you can read more about this on [the Scottish Trans website](https://www.scottishtrans.org/trans-equality/change-of-name/).
