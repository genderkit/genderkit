The chemicals in depilatory cream may cause skin irritation. It is very important to always perform a patch test first by using the chemicals on a small area the day before.

Depilatory creams contain chemicals which weaken the proteins in hair, making it weak. Once the cream has been applied and left for a short time, the hair can then be easily scraped off using a plastic scraper.

Depilatory creams can be bought in a shop and normally cost between £2 and £6.
