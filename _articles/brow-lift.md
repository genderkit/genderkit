### What should I be aware of?

Possible complications of a brow lift include:

- nerve damage causing numbness of the forehead
- numbness in the scalp lasting up to 18 months
- leaking cerebrospinal fluid
- hair loss {% cite altman2017 -l 307 %} 

We have so far been unable to find information on the long-term effects of brow lift surgery.

To ensure you are receiving the safest possible treatment, you should follow [this advice from the Care Quality Commission](http://www.cqc.org.uk/help-advice/help-choosing-care-services/choosing-cosmetic-surgery) on how to choose cosmetic surgery.

### Are there other options?

A temporary alternative to raise the apparent height of your eyebrows is to remove hair from the bottom of the eyebrow using [plucking]({% link _articles/plucking.md %}) or [waxing]({% link _articles/waxing.md %}).
