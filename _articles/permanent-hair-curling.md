Hair is made from keratin proteins. These keratin proteins are held into shape by chemical bonds.

These bonds can be broken if a chemical (normally thioglycolate) are applied to the hair, allowing the hair to be moved into new shapes like curls or waves by wrapping it around rollers. Another chemical can then be applied to the hair (normally hydrogen peroxide) that reforms the bonds, fixing the hair in the new position {% cite peacock2005hair -l 55 %}.

To speed up this process, some hairdressers will use a "drying hood" which produces heat which encourages the chemical reaction.

An alternative to chemical curling is to break the chemical bonds by [hair curling]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hair-curling.md %}) using heat. This is much more of a temporary solution as it will generally only last a few days or until the hair becomes wet.

Prices for permanent hair curling range from £40-100. Different shapes of wave or curl require different amounts of work, affecting the price.
