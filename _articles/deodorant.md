- *Deodorants* are products that neutralise body odours. They often also add a fragrance to help conceal any remaining body odour.
- *Antiperspirants* additionally reduce the amount of sweat the body produces. Sweat encourages the growth of microbes that are responsible for body odours.

### Where can I learn more?

If you experience ongoing problems with body odour or excessive sweating, you can find more information and advice on the [NHS website](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Body-odour/Pages/Introduction.aspx).
