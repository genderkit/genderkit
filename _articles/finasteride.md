{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Finasteride use has been linked to liver problems and depression {% cite seal:2007 -l 174 %}. It is not normally prescribed to anyone at risk of pregnancy due to potential effects on unborn children {% cite finasteride %}.

### Why might I want finasteride?

Finasteride is used to treat hair loss caused by testosterone. 

It can also be used to reduce body hair and slow facial hair growth {% cite seal2017 -l 236 %}.

### Are there other options?

A commonly used alternative to finasteride is [minoxidil]({% link _articles/minoxidil.md %}), which is a topical cream or foam instead of a pill, and unlike finasteride can be obtained without a prescription.

### How do I use finasteride?

Finasteride comes as a pill you take daily. It is a "prescription-only medication", meaning you are only able to get it from a pharmacy by giving them a valid prescription. 

You will have to take finasteride for three to six months before you will notice a difference. If you stop taking finasteride, your hair will return to normal within 9 to 12 months {% cite finasteride %}.

### How much will it cost?

NHS guidelines indicate that finasteride is not funded by the NHS. You can, however, ask your GP to write you a "private prescription" that allows you to obtain the medication if you pay the costs for it yourself.

Finasteride costs around £5-£10 per week depending on your dosage level.

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about hair loss treatments on [the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Hair-loss/Pages/Treatment.aspx).
