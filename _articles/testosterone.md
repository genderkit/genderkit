### How do I stay safe?

{% include iconlist2 iconlist="safety" %}

### What should I be aware of?

{% include iconlist2 iconlist="aware-of" %}

Using testosterone can increase your risks of polycythaemia (too many red blood cells which can increase stroke risk), liver problems {% cite seal2017 -l 239 %}, and obstructive sleep apnoea (stopping breathing during sleep which can lead to heart problems or sudden death). Testosterone does not remove the risk of pregnancy {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %} and should not be used as a method of contraception {% cite deroo2017 -l 136 %}. If you become pregnant, you should stop testosterone use, as it can damage a developing foetus {% cite wpath7 fsrh2017contraceptive %}.

### Is testosterone right for me?

Testosterone causes a large number of physical changes to your body, including significant changes to body fat distribution, hair growth, and pitch of voice. Testosterone has noticeable effects on mood and thinking, and can increase energy and aggression, but can also help some people feel "more settled" in their body {% cite seal2017 -l 239 %}.

However, many effects of testosterone, such as changes to your voice or body hair, are permanent or not easily reversed. You might want some of the effects of testosterone, but not all of them, which may mean testosterone is not the right option for you. You can talk to your gender clinician if you would like to further discuss the possible effects.

Testosterone may cause acne. You can read more about acne and how to manage it on the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Acne/Pages/Introduction.aspx). 

While taking testosterone, you will still need to have [cervical screening tests](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cervical-screening-test/pages/introduction.aspx) if you have a cervix.

### How do I get testosterone?

Most people get testosterone using the UK system for gender medicine. Read [our step-by-step guide to getting medical support]({% link _resources/medical.md %}) for information about using that system. Some people also choose to [access hormones without a medical diagnosis]({% link _resources/hrt-without-diagnosis.md %}).

For testosterone therapy to begin, it is required that any other significant medical or mental health issues are "reasonably well controlled" {% cite cr181 -l 24 %}. This means that a medical professional is currently helping or has helped you manage the condition.

### What kinds of testosterone are there?

{% include iconlist2 iconlist="forms" %}

Testosterone is commonly available as depot injections or as gels applied to the skin {% cite seal2017 -l 241 %}. Oral (pill) forms of testosterone are rarely used as blood testing is more complex, and patches  are rarely used in the UK (partly because of the frequency of bad reactions to patches) {% cite cr181 -l 37 %}.

### What else might I want?

In a small proportion of people menstruation (periods) is not stopped by testosterone therapy, and either [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) {% cite ngicns-endocrine -l 5 %} or [progesterone]({% link _articles/progesterone.md %}) {% cite seal:2007 %} can be used to do this in addition to testosterone.

In the UK, some clinicians have in the past recommended that people taking testosterone long-term should have a [hysterectomy]({% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}). They theorised that as testosterone suppresses menstruation (periods), which could lead to endometrial hyperplasia (thickening of the lining of the womb), this might increase the risk of cancer {% cite seal2017 -l 240 %}. However, subsequent studies have not shown any evidence of an increased risk of reproductive cancers from testosterone use, and they do not suggest any need for hysterectomy {% cite toze2018risky %}. Hysterectomy for people taking testosterone is optional and you may feel the risks involved in a major operation are unnecessary. If you decide not to undergo hysterectomy it has been suggested that scans to check for thickening of the endometrium every two years could reduce any potential risks {% cite seal2017 -l 240 %}.
