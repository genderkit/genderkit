### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Salpingo-oophorectomy results in permanent destruction of the ovaries and is irreversible. After oophorectomy you will be infertile and unable to have children unless you have previously carried out [gamete storage]({% link _articles/gamete-storage.md %}) (i.e. egg storage).
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

{% capture warn %}
After salpingo-oophorectomy, you will need to take at least one sex hormone ([oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %})) in order to prevent medical problems like osteoporosis.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

### How do I get salpingo-oophorectomy?

You will normally need to meet the following conditions to be eligible for salpingo-oophorectomy:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the
patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications
or is otherwise unable to take hormones) {% cite cr181 %}. 

Salpingo-oophorectomy for other medical reasons is not subject to these requirements.

Salpingo-oophorectomy is often carried out as part of [hysterectomy]({% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}) surgery, which removes the uterus (womb).

### How do I get ready for surgery?

Doing some preparation in advance can help make sure everything goes smoothly during your hospital stay and recovery. To help you avoid forgetting to do or buy something we have created a [Getting ready for gender surgeries page]({% link surgery-checklist.md %}).

### How much will it cost?

{% capture info %}
Outside of Scotland, this is usually only funded as part of [phalloplasty]({% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}) or [metoidioplasty]({% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %})
{% endcapture %}
{% include regional regionalinfo=info %}

The NHS will normally fund total salpingo-oophorectomy and total [hysterectomy]({% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}) for patients who are undergoing [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) therapy.
