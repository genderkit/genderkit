### Why might I want to use support services?

Changing things about your gender can bring up lots of questions and unexpected emotions. Often, it can be helpful to talk to other people and get their input.

### How do I get support?

In the UK, there are several specialist services available to provide you with information and support. If these services cannot help you themselves, they may be able to point you to other people who can help.

[Mermaids](https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/contact-us/) provide phone, online chat, and email support for transgender youth aged up to 25 in the UK.

[Mindline Trans+](http://bristolmind.org.uk/help-and-counselling/mindline-transplus/) is a helpline for adults in the UK who identify as trans or non-binary, run by mental health charity Mind.

If you are on a gender service waiting list or are a current gender service user, you can also get support from:
