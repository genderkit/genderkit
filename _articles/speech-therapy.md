Speech and language therapy can be used by people wanting to change the quality of their voice, raise the pitch of their voice, or lower their average pitch. 

A trained speech therapist helps you discover what you would like your voice to sound like and helps you acheive those goals. Speech therapy may be one-on-one, or in a group therapy setting.

Speech and language therapy is often provided free of charge by UK gender identity clinics, with several clinics having their own in-house speech and language therapists. 

Private speech and language therapists who advertise specific experience around gender include:
