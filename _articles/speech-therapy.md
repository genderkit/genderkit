### Why might I want speech therapy?

Speech and language therapy can be used by people wanting to change the quality of their voice, raise the pitch of their voice, or lower their average pitch. A trained speech therapist helps you discover what you would like your voice to sound like and helps you achieve those goals. 

### Are there other options?

Many people make changes to their voice on their own without help from a speech therapist. You can find more information about doing this on your own on our [page about working on your voice]({% link _articles/working-on-your-voice.md %}).

To *lower* your voice, you can practice using the bottom part of your existing vocal range more frequently (to lower your average pitch), and speech therapy can help with this. However, it is not normally possible to increase your vocal range to be able to reach lower pitches than you can already. To do this, people normally use [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) instead. The effects of testosterone on voice are permanent, and will only affect certain aspects of your voice. To change other aspects of voice that are normally associated with gender, like inflection or speech rhythm, you might still wish to work with a speech therapist.

To *raise* your voice, it is possible to learn to reach higher pitches with practice, possibly with the help of speech therapy. [Oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) has no effect on the voice.

A minority of people are unable to reach their goals through speech and language therapy or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) treatment and undergo surgical interventions to change their voice.

### How do I get speech therapy?

Many UK gender services offer speech therapy after they have given a [diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}). 

In some parts of the UK, it is also possible to access therapy without having been referred to a gender service or having been given a diagnosis by them. To do this, you will need to be seen by your local Speech and Language Therapy team. Depending on the area, you may need to ask your GP for a referral, though some services will allow people to self-refer.

Speech therapy may be one-on-one, or in a group therapy setting.
