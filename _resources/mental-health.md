### How to get help

If you'd like to talk to someone about problems you're having, we have [a list of UK support services and helplines]({% link _articles/support-services.md %}) that help trans, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming people and people who are thinking about their gender.

We also have a page with detailed information about [how to access counselling]({% link _articles/counselling.md %}).

If you are finding you are struggling with mental health issues that continue over a longer period, it could help you to make an appointment to see your GP as they will be able to arrange for treatments like talking therapies or medication. 

### Information for young people

Mind have an [information hub](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/for-children-and-young-people/) for young people, with information about a range of issues.

If you're a parent worried about your child's mental health, Young Minds have a [helpline](https://youngminds.org.uk/find-help/for-parents/parents-helpline/) specifically for parents.

### If you're worried about hurting yourself or other people

If you think you are seeing or hearing things that aren't there, or you think you may harm someone around you, please read [this page on the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/psychosis/).

If you are hurting yourself in order to cope - even if it is by exercising too much, using alcohol or drugs, or not eating enough or too much - it's important that you get help. The NHS have a page about [self-harming and how to get help](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/self-harm).

If you're worried about killing yourself, please [click here right now to find out what to do to get help](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/suicide/).

### If you're worried about someone else

It can be difficult to know what to do if you're worried about someone else's mental health.

Thankfully, you can find information about what to do online on the NHS website:

- [Worried about someone else having suicidal thoughts?](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/suicide/#worried-about-someone-else)
- [Getting help for others if you're worried someone is having hallucinations or delusions](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/psychosis/#getting-help-for-others)
- [How to help someone with depression](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/signs-someone-is-depressed/)
- [Supporting someone with an eating disorder](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/supporting-someone-with-an-eating-disorder/)

If the person you're supporting would rather not have formal medical help for their problems, you might find one of the following resources useful:

- [Mental health intervention protocol](https://wiki.queercare.network/Mental_Health_Intervention_Protocol) by QueerCare (If this link fails, try the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201115170136/https://wiki.queercare.network/Mental_Health_Intervention_Protocol))
- [What to do if a friend goes mad](https://asylummagazine.org/2019/03/what-to-do-if-a-friend-goes-mad-by-donnard-white/?fbclid=IwAR1OH7o6Q07h7ekQ1BRz4dBmnYi-_ex3DePsjvsF5O6mKdMSfxQwUmiGqRU) by Donnard White

It's generally unhelpful to impose help on somebody who doesn't want it, or to try to help them in ways they don't want. Talk with the person you're worried about and act with their consent as much as possible.

Remember that some people will have had bad experiences with police in the past. They may not wish to interact with emergency services, even if they are not police, as those services could decide to contact the police. Unless there is an immediate threat to life or limb, consider carefully if the situation could be resolved without involving the emergency services, as it might cause further distress to the person you are trying to help.
