Transphobic hate crime is:

- threats and intimidation
- harassment and bullying
- physical harm and assault
- and damage to property

where the perpetrator is motivated by how they perceive a person's gender identity.

Hate crimes can also be motivated by a persons sexuality, disability, religion, race, ethnicity or nationality {% cite hatecrime2016 %}.
