### Important notes

<section class="info">
<h3 id="caveat">Caveat</h3>
<p>Waiting times indicate how long patients who have just been invited for an appointment have waited for. As demand is currently increasing over time, this means it is likely you will wait <em>longer</em> than the time shown on this page.</p>
</section>

Waiting time information shown on this page is taken from information given directly to us by the services or published on their website.

Many gender services currently have very lengthy wait lists, and it can be very difficult to be waiting for so long. You can find ways you can get help while you are waiting on [our Mental Health page]({% link _resources/mental-health.md %}).

{% include wait-summary tag="Gender Clinics" icon="tick" title="Free UK-based services" free=true description="You can access these gender services for free by asking your GP to make a referral. However, these services have significant waiting lists, and may require a wait of several years before being seen. They will also only accept you as a patient if you are registered with a GP in a specific area." %}

{% include wait-transfer tag="Gender Clinics" icon="tick" title="Transfers" free=true description="NHS services vary in how they handle wait times for patients transferring from other NHS services. The following information shows whether your original referral time will be honoured if you transfer to each service." %}

*Youth services*: note that the wait shown for GIDS is an *average* wait, and your actual wait may be considerably longer or shorter than that shown above. Recent waits for GIDS patients (2021) have in some cases been as long as 38 months {% cite gids2022foi %}. GIDS patients seeking puberty blockers will be referred to the UCLH paediatric endocrinology unit, which may entail an additional wait to be seen, and an independent Multi-Professional Review Group may have to be held to consider your case which can cause a further additional delay. After prescribing puberty blockers, GIDS require a further wait of at least a year before prescribing cross-sex hormones {% cite gids2022puberty %}.

{% include wait-summary tag="Gender Clinics" icon="pound" title="Paid UK-based services" free=false description="There are also several private gender services which charge fees but which may have significantly shorter waiting lists. You may wish to use these services while on the waiting list for an NHS service." %}

{% include wait-full tag="Gender Clinics" icon="tick" title="Free UK-based services" free=true description="You can access these gender services for free by asking your GP to make a referral. However, these services have significant waiting lists, and may require a wait of several years before being seen. They will also only accept you as a patient if you are registered with a GP in a specific area." %}
